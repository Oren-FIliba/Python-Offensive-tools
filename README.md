# Python3-Offensive-Tools
This is a repository for me to display and share some simple python3 offensive tools that I built.

## The Tools:
  
  * Pscan_SSH.py = a port scanner that scan the ports randomly and in random times.
                   its checks if port 22 (SSH) is in the open ports and if it is than
                   the user gets the option to run a Threaded Brute force attack.
